      <h1>About</h1>
      <div class="wrapper">
        <p>After trying my hand at project management and planning engineering, I came to the realization that I needed to find a way to combine my passion for both problem solving and tech. Lo` and behold the world of Programming! I enrolled at Makers Academy on their intensive programming and web development course. I have since furthered my studies and commitment to becoming an incredible Programmer. It has been exhilarating, exhausting, frustrating and fun. I’m now looking for a Front End Developer role in a place where I will be encouraged to push myself and supported in my efforts to expand my skill set and become the best Developer I can be.</p>

If given the tiniest opportunity, I will tell you why Digimon is superior to Pokémon.</p>
